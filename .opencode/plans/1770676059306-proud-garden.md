# Plan: Add Changeset Claude Skill

## Goal

Convert the changeset slash command from `../repos/.claude/commands/changeset.md` into a Claude skill at `.claude/skills/changeset/SKILL.md` in this repo, adapting it for the `cli-lsp-client` package.

## What Changes

### Create `.claude/skills/changeset/SKILL.md`

A new skill file with:

- **Frontmatter**: `name: changeset`, `description` with trigger keywords (e.g., "create a changeset", "prepare release", "changeset from git history")
- **Body**: Adapted instructions from the source command, with the package name changed from `'repos'` to `'cli-lsp-client'`

### Skill content (adapted from source)

```markdown
---
name: changeset
description: Create a changeset from git history for the current branch. Use when the user asks to create a changeset, prepare a release, or generate a changeset from commits.
---

# Create Changeset from Git History

Create a changeset for the current branch automatically:

1. Gather all changes:
   - Run `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to get all commits on this branch
   - Run `git diff` to see unstaged changes
   - Run `git diff --cached` to see staged changes
2. Analyze the commits and current changes to determine the semver bump:
   - `major` if any commit contains "BREAKING" or "!"
   - `minor` if any commit starts with "feat"
   - `patch` otherwise (fix, chore, refactor, docs, etc.)
3. Generate a concise summary (1-2 sentences) describing all changes (commits + uncommitted)
4. Create a changeset file by running `bunx changeset add --empty` then editing the created file, OR by directly writing a new file to `.changeset/` with a random kebab-case name (e.g., `tall-lions.md`)

The changeset file format:

    ---
    'cli-lsp-client': <patch|minor|major>
    ---

    <your generated summary>

Do not ask any questions - determine everything from the git history and create the changeset file directly.
```

## Files to Create

- `.claude/skills/changeset/SKILL.md`

## Verification

1. Confirm the file exists at `.claude/skills/changeset/SKILL.md`
2. Confirm frontmatter has required `name` and `description` fields
3. Confirm the package name is `cli-lsp-client` (not `repos`)
4. Restart Claude Code and test by asking "create a changeset" — the skill should be loaded automatically
